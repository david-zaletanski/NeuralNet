# Neural Network

**Updated README:** 1/28/2018

This was an expriemtnal implementation of a feed forward neural network, using a backpropagation training algorithm. Although the neural net could be configured for use in many scenarios, this project contains a fairly basic demo program that trains it to replicate the output of a XOR circuit.
